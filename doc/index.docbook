		<sect2 id="board-layout">
			<title>Board Layout</title>
			<para>A chessboard consists of 64 equal squares arranged in eight rows and eight columns.  The squares are arranged in 
			two alternating colors, white and black.  Many different materials are used to make chessboards, so the lighter 
			colored material is known as white and the darker material is known as black.</para>
			<para>Parts of the board are known by special names:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Rank - the eight horizontal rows of the chess board are called ranks.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>File - the eight vertical columns of the chess board are called files.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Diagonal - a straight line of squares of the same color running at an angle from
				one edge of the board to another edge is called a diagonal.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Center - the four squares found in the middle of the board are called the center.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>Each individual square has a name so records of the moves of the game can be kept.  Several naming systems exist, 
			but <quote>algebraic notation</quote> is the most popular and is the official system.  In this system, each square is
			named for the row and column in which it is found.  The ranks (rows) are numbered from 1 to 8 beginning with white's
			side of the board and moving to black's side of the board.  The files (columns) are labeled by lower case letters from
			a to h moving from left to right based on the white player's viewpoint.  The square is named by the letter followed by
			the number.  Thus the lower left hand square is known as a1.  The naming structure can be seen in the following 
			diagram:</para>

			<para>The pieces are placed on the white and black side of the board in the same manner.  In the first row beginning
			at both outer edges and moving inward, place the rook (sometimes called the castle), the knight (sometimes called
			the horse) and the bishop.  For the two remaining squares, place the queen on the square with the same color.  Place
			the king on the final square.  When completed, the same pieces face each other across the board.  On the second row
			place a row of pawns.  The finished board then looks like the diagram below.</para>

		<title>Piece Movement</title>
		<sect2 id="all-movement">
			<title>Moving and Capturing</title>
			<para>Chess has six types of pieces: the Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen and King. Each piece has its own 
			unique way to move. There are some similarities between the moves of the various pieces.  All the pieces 
			except the knight move in a straight line - horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They cannot move past the
			end of the board and return on the other side. The edge of the board is a boundary which cannot be crossed.  
			All the pieces except the knight may not jump over other pieces - all squares between the square where the piece 
			starts its move and where it ends its move must be empty.  The move may not end on a square presently occupied 
			by a piece of the same color.</para>
			
			<para>If the square where a piece ends its move contains an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is <quote>captured</quote>, 
			and it is removed from play.  All the pieces may be captured except the king.  The game ends on the move before the
			king is captured - <quote><link linkend="checkmate">checkmate</link></quote>.  Capturing always requires the attacking piece 
			to land on the square of the opponent's piece while making a normal move.  The only exception is for capturing a pawn 
			<link linkend="en_passant-movement">en passant</link>.  You are not required to capture a piece when there is an opportunity 
			to do so, capturing is an option.  The only time that capture is required is if the king is under attack and capturing the 
			attacking piece is the only way to stop the attack.</para>
			
			<para>In the picture below, the white rook can move to the right, left, up or down (vertically or horizontally) in straight lines.
			It can move down and to the right any number of squares until the end of the board is reached.  These squares have a green
			X on them.  It can move a maximum of two squares to the left.  The remainder of the board is blocked by a piece of the same
			color, in this case a white knight.  The rook cannot jump over the knight to reach the end of the board.  It can move only one square
			up before being blocked by the black pawn.  It can capture the pawn by moving two squares up and landing on the pawn, since the
			pawn is an opposing piece (piece of a different color).  This square has a red X on it.  It cannot jump over the pawn to reach 
			the end of the board.  Therefore, the rook has a total of ten squares where it can go.</para>

			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-move-limits.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
			
			<para>To begin the game, white moves first.  The players then alternate making one move at a time.  You must move on your turn, you are not allowed to pass.</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="pawn-movement">
			<title>Pawn</title>
			<para>The pawn is the most numerous and the least powerful piece on the chessboard.  Pawns are unusual in their movement.  Generally 
			the pawn moves forward only, one square at a time.  An exception is the first time a pawn is moved, it may move forward two squares. 
			The pawn cannot jump over other pieces; any piece directly in front of a pawn blocks its advance to that square. The pawn is the 
			only piece that cannot move backward.  The pawn is also the only piece that does not capture in the same way that it moves.  The 
			pawn captures an opposing piece by moving diagonally one square - it cannot capture by moving straight ahead.</para>
			
			<para>In the picture below the lower pawn is still on its original square, so it may move one or two squares forward (indicted
			by the green X).  It may capture by moving to the right or left at a diagonal, but only if that square is occupied by an opposing
			piece (indicated by the red X).  Otherwise, it may not move diagonally.  The upper pawn has already moved from its original square.
			It may move only one square forward.  Likewise, it can capture moving to the left or right diagonally if the square contains an
			opposing piece.</para>
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-move-pawn.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
			
			<para>The pawn also is involved in two special moves.  The first is the <link linkend="en_passant-movement">en passant capture</link>
			where a pawn is captured on its initial two square move.  The second is the <link linkend="pawn-promotion-movement">pawn promotion</link>
			where a pawn is promoted to another piece when the pawn reaches the other end of the board.</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="bishop-movement">
			<title>Bishop</title>
			<para>The Bishop moves in a straight line diagonally on the board.  It can move as many squares as wanted, until it meets the end of
			the board or another piece.  The bishop cannot jump over other pieces.  The bishop captures on the same path it moves, by landing 
			on the square of the opposing piece.  Because of the way the bishop moves, the piece always remains on the same color squares it
			started on.  Each player begins with two bishops, one on the black-colored and one on the white-colored squares.  They are frequently
			referred to as the <quote>dark-squared</quote> bishop and <quote>light-squared</quote> bishop.  The bishops can also be named according 
			to the side they begin on - king's bishop and queen's bishop.</para>  
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-move-bishop.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="rook-movement">
			<title>Rook</title>
			<para>The rook moves in a straight line either horizontally or vertically through any number of unoccupied squares, until it reaches 
			the end of board or it is blocked by another piece.  It cannot jump over other pieces.  The rook captures on the same path 
			it moves, by occupying the square on which an enemy piece stands.  The rook can land on any square on the board, therefore it 
			is one of the more powerful pieces on the board.</para>
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-move-rook.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
			<para>The rook is also involved in a special move.  It is the <link linkend="castling-movement">castling move</link>
			where a rook and the king are grouped into a defensive position.</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="knight-movement">
			<title>Knight</title>
			<para>The Knight is the most special piece in chess, having a flexibility that makes it a powerful piece. The knight is the 
			only piece on the board that may jump over other pieces.  The knight moves two squares horizontally or vertically and 
			then one more square at a right-angle.  The knight’s move is shaped as an <quote>L</quote>.  The knight always lands on a square 
			opposite in color from its initial square.  The knight can jump over pieces of either color while going to its 
			destination square, but it does not capture any pieces it jumps over.  The knight captures by landing on the square 
			of the opposing piece.  The knight cannot land on a square occupied by a piece of the same color.  Since the knight's 
			movement is not in a straight line, it can attack a queen, bishop, or rook without being reciprocally attacked by that 
			piece.</para>
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-move-knight.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="queen-movement">
			<title>Queen</title>
			<para>The Queen is considered the most powerful piece on the board.  It can move any number of squares in a straight 
			line - either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  The queen moves like the rook and bishop combined.  Unless
			capturing, the queen must move to an unoccupied square; and it cannot jump over pieces.  The queen captures on the 
			same path it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece.</para>
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-move-queen.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="king-movement">
			<title>King</title>
			<para>The King is the most important piece in chess. If the king is trapped so that its capture is unavoidable, the game is 
			over and that player loses.  The king has little mobility, so it is also considered one of the weakest pieces in the game.  
			The king can move to any adjacent square.  That is, it can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or 
			diagonally.  It cannot move onto a square occupied by a piece of the same color.  The king captures another piece in 
			the same way it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece.  There is an additional limit on the movement of 
			the king.  The king may not move to a square which would put the king under attack by an opposing piece (called in <quote>check</quote>). 
			As a result of this limit, two kings may never stand next to each other - since moving next to the opposing king would
			put the moving king into check.  The king can also be forced to move or capture if the king is under attack 
			(<quote>check</quote>) and the only way to stop the attack is to move the king.</para>

		<title>Special Moves</title>
		<sect2 id="en_passant-movement">
			<title>En Passant</title>
			<para>When the rule to allow a pawn to move two squares on its first move was added, a pawn could potentially evade capture by an
			opponent's pawn by going past a square under attack.  The en passant capture (from the French for <quote>in passing</quote>) was 
			added to prevent this.  The capture is made exactly as if the pawn had moved only one square forward.  There are 
			special conditions for the en passant capture:   
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>A pawn must move two squares from its initial position in a single move.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>An opposing pawn must be attacking the square the first pawn moved over.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>The first pawn can be captured as if it moved only one square.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>The capture can only be made at the opponent's next move.  If the capture is not made,

			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>In the diagram below, the white pawn has not moved from its initial position.  Its first move can be 
			one or two squares ahead.  The first square is under attack by the black pawn (pawns attack diagonally) as
			indicated by the red X.  The white pawn moves ahead two squares, avoiding the attack.  On the next move, 
			the black pawn moves into the square where the white pawn would have moved if it could only move a single 
			square on the first move.  The black pawn successfully attacks the white pawn, and captures it 
			<quote>en passant</quote>.  The white pawn is removed from play.</para>
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-enpassant.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="castling-movement">
			<title>Castling</title>
			<para>Castling uses the king and one rook, and is the only time in a game when more than one piece may be moved 
			during a single turn.  In castling a king is moved two squares towards the rook and the rook is then moved to 
			the square on the other side of the king.</para>
			
			<para>Castling has some rigid requirements:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Both the king and the rook may never have moved during the game.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>There are no pieces between the king and the rook.</para></listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			
			<para>There are two forms of castling.  One is called <quote>kingside castling</quote>.  It is also known as 
			<quote>short castling</quote>, since it is performed to the short side of the board and the rook only has to 
			move two squares to the opposite side of the king. It is diagramed below:</para>
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-castle-kingside.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
			
			<para>The second form of castling is called <quote>queenside castling</quote>, where the king moves towards the
			square vacated by the queen.  It is also known as <quote>long castling</quote>, since it is performed to the long
			side of the board and the rook has to move three squares to the opposite side of the king.  It is diagramed below:</para>
			<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-castle-queenside.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
			
			<note><title>Note:</title>

		<sect2 id="pawn-promotion-movement">
			<title>Pawn Promotion</title>
			<para>When a pawn has reached the other end of the board it cannot move further, since 
			it always must move forward and not backwards.  The pawn is then turned
			(<quote>promoted</quote>) into a queen, rook, bishop or knight.  This promotion
			occurs as part of the move.  Usually the piece chosen is the queen, often called
			<quote>queening</quote>. The other pieces are sometimes chosen when their movements 
			will aid in checkmate, often called <quote>under promoting</quote>.  The pawn can be
			turned into a piece even if that type of piece is still on the board.  Thus you can have

		<title>Time Controls</title>
		<para>Many games of chess use time controls to speed the play or ensure a finish in a reasonable period.
		There are two main forms of time controls.</para>
		
		<para>The first time control type is moves-per-time.  In this type a player must complete a specified
		number of moves within a fixed period of time.</para>
		
		<para>The second time control type is called <quote>sudden death</quote>.  In this type there
		is a fixed amount of time to complete the game, regardless of the number of moves made.</para>
		
		<para>Within the time control there can be a time delay to compensate for the time lost in physically
		making a move.  In the <quote>Bronstein delay</quote> the clock does not start running at the beginning 
		of the player's move until the delay time is over.  If the move is completed before the delay time expires, 
		no time is subtracted from the player's clock.  In the <quote>Fischer delay</quote> the delay time is added 
		to the player's remaining time before the move.  If the move is made before the delay time expires, 
		the remaining delay time is kept by the player and their clock time increases.  Similarly, a fixed time can 
		be added to the player's clock after a move is completed.  When time is added to the clock, the time amount is 
		refered to as the <quote>time increment</quote>.</para>
		
		<para>Time controls vary widely depending upon the game, game type and any sponsor.  Also during a game there 
		may be several types of time controls joined together, with unused time added to the next time control.  For 
		all major World Chess Federation (FIDE) events the time control is 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed 
		by 30 minutes sudden death, with an additional 30 seconds per move beginning with the first move.  The defaults 
		on FICS (Free Internet Chess Server) are 2 minutes for the game (sudden death), plus 12 seconds time increment 
		for each move.  Many major events use 90 minutes sudden death for their time control.  The US Chess Federation 
		Blitz chess time control is 5 minutes for the game, with no time delays/increments.</para>

		<title>Markers</title>
		<para> 
			Markers are highlights of squares on the chessboard.  They can be used to show legal moves for your
			chess piece, the opponent's previous move, or a king in check.  Their color and shape depends on which 
			theme you are using. They can be toggled on/off in the general settings section of the configuration menu.
		</para>
		<para>
			Clicking on your piece during your turn displays a marker on every square on which that piece can be moved.
			The picture shows the legal moves for the white queen.
		</para>
		<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-moving-queen.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
		<para>
			When your opponent has made a move, their last move is indicated by markers.  One marker shows the
			initial position of the chess piece, and a second highlights the new position of the chess piece.
		</para>
		<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="Knights-lastmove.png" /></imageobject></mediaobject>
		<para>
			If the opponent's last move put your king under attack (<quote>check</quote>), your
			king and all attacking pieces are highlighted as well.
